Created in collaboration with Bronx community members, it is an offering to the Bronx and an invitation to reclaim space. The piece was supposed to premier in May 2020 at BAAD! \n The Bronx was always the source of inspiration for the project but that feeling intensified over the past few months. I’ve spent hours during this pandemic walking around the borough and getting to know it more than ever. Everywhere I turned, on every block and street corner, I saw both creativity and resilience bursting from the seams. That inspired me to keep making work that centers our stories, especially those that are often untold or forgotten.",

Nowadays, I work at home with the space that is available. The process itself has also changed since now I include more planning before making and, in some way, this has transformed the scale and type of my work too. Almost all my work in progress is digital or has stayed in a digital format for now. \nI've transitioned to photographing more inside my apartment since meeting people has become more difficult due to Covid restrictions. This has allowed me to explore more in detail lighting techniques and specifics of studio photography which has been challenging but fruitful. I'm excited to see the outcomes of a new way of making that I've been experiencing the last few months, and to keep expanding the work that I started with my thesis project",

        "text": "While most artists in DIAP are used to the studio being the laptop, I don’t think any of us were expecting what happened during our final school year. The laptop would become the site of our labor (if we were lucky enough to keep a job), where our virtual classes would be held, where the art would have to be made, and where even our leisure time would now take place while under different variations of lockdowns. \nAll distinctions between these modes of living have collapsed into the digital, making time feel out of joint and art sometimes feel unimportant in comparison to the chaotic and absorbing reality we’re living through. At the beginning of lockdown, I had a hard time justifying my art practice. Living through history made art seem meek and naive and the George Floyd uprisings made art feel even more futile in comparison. But as time passed and institutions and civilization itself began to visibly crumble under the weight of the pandemic, new possibilities, new futures seemed to make themselves visible and inspiration started to seep back into art and life.\nAfter seeing much of the art world respond to the Trump presidency with out-of-touch liberal morality theater and didactic protest art, I’ve become more interested in making art about conspiracy subcultures from a morally ambiguous and complex position. Now is as good a time as ever to ask ourselves “doesn’t a sick society call for a sick art?”",
