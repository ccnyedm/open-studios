Created in collaboration with Bronx community members, it is an offering to the Bronx and an invitation to reclaim space. The piece was supposed to premier in May 2020 at BAAD! \n The Bronx was always the source of inspiration for the project but that feeling intensified over the past few months. Iâ€™ve spent hours during this pandemic walking around the borough and getting to know it more than ever. Everywhere I turned, on every block and street corner, I saw both creativity and resilience bursting from the seams. That inspired me to keep making work that centers our stories, especially those that are often untold or forgotten.",

Nowadays, I work at home with the space that is available. The process itself has also changed since now I include more planning before making and, in some way, this has transformed the scale and type of my work too. Almost all my work in progress is digital or has stayed in a digital format for now. \nI've transitioned to photographing more inside my apartment since meeting people has become more difficult due to Covid restrictions. This has allowed me to explore more in detail lighting techniques and specifics of studio photography which has been challenging but fruitful. I'm excited to see the outcomes of a new way of making that I've been experiencing the last few months, and to keep expanding the work that I started with my thesis project",
